Whazaa
======

A webOS 2.x and 3.x service and application for communicating with WhatsApp.

This is not an official WhatsApp application.

This is a clone of my quite messy source tree. I don't really have time to maintain this right now, so I'm giving it to everyone.

The "waapi" folder really should be a submodule referencing http://github.com/ericblade/node-wa but I don't really 
have time to mess with that right now.

This currently implements the now deprecated WhatsApp 1.1 protocol.  This does not seem to work on WA anymore,
and needs some help getting it to work with WA 1.2.  This probably won't be too difficult for someone who has 
the time to put into it.

Help for dealing with WhatsApp 1.2:
